# Clipboard Tool Ex
This is a simple clipboard management tool.
The only user interface is the tray icon and the menu when you right-click on it. It can:

- Display what data is in your clipboard currently.
- Clean-up your clipboard at any-time you want.
- Clean-up your clipboard after you copied something in certain time automatically, prevents leakage of sensitive information.
- Remembers what you just copied and allows you to restore them later, in an automatic way and/or at any-time you want.
- Notify you when the content inside your clipboard is changed or cleared.
